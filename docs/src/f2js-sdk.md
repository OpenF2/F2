## Upgrading

It is a goal of ours to make upgrading to the latest version of F2 a minor effort for development teams. Releasing feature enhancements, addressing bugs or security patches, and working hard to maintain backward compatibility for F2.js APIs&mdash;while constantly pushing the boundaries&mdash;are all part of evolving a web framework for the financial services industry.

The details from each release of F2, minor and major, are tracked in the [changelog](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/wiki/Changelog).
