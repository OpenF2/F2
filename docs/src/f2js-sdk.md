# F2.js SDK

<p class="lead">F2 enables you to efficiently create fully-integrated, multi-vendor, multi-asset class and multi-channel apps and deploy them in as many app ecosystems as you want.</p>

Developers who adhere to the F2 standard will make it possible for multiple apps, developed independently by different organizations or individuals, to function together creating a seamless and integrated experience.

## Version 2

<div class="alert alert-block alert-info">
    The F2 Team is working on a major revision to the F2 framework. Visit the project on GitHub to review the [revisions draft](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/wiki/F2-Version-2), [the F2.js code](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/tree/v2-restructured) and [v2 Issues](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/issues?labels=v2&page=1&state=open).

## F2.js

F2 is an open framework and to get Container and App Developers started, there is a JavaScript SDK&mdash;called F2.js&mdash;in addition to example apps as part of an open-source project maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/).

## Download

Anyone is free to download F2.js from the [F2 project repository on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/). Once downloaded, F2.js can be added to any web page using a script tag:

```javascript
<script src="/path/to/your/container/f2.js"></script>
```

The latest version of F2.js is **{{version}}**.

### Packages

Packages are variants of F2.js. They are ideally used when, for example, a container already has jQuery or [sandboxed apps](http://docs.openf2.org/app-development.html#secure-apps) aren't needed. In circumstances where not all F2 features are required, Container Providers can use smaller, faster, lighter-weight versions of F2.js. Choose one below:

* **Basic**: 
	* Includes: json2, EventEmitter, and F2
    * Development: [F2.basic.js](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/blob/master/sdk/packages/f2.basic.js)
    * Production: [F2.basic.min.js](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/blob/master/sdk/packages/f2.basic.min.js) (7.6kb)
* **No easyXDM**:
	* Includes: json2, EventEmitter, jQuery, Bootstrap Modal, and F2
    * Development: [f2.no-easyXDM.js](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/blob/master/sdk/packages/f2.no-easyXDM.js)
    * Production: [f2.no-easyXDM.min.js](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/blob/master/sdk/packages/f2.no-easyXDM.min.js) (30.4kb)	    	    
* **No Bootstrap**: 
	* Includes: json2, EventEmitter, jQuery, and F2
    * Development: [F2.no-bootstrap.js](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/blob/master/sdk/packages/f2.no-bootstrap.js)
    * Production: [F2.no-bootstrap.min.js](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/blob/master/sdk/packages/f2.no-bootstrap.min.js) (33.6kb)
* **No jQuery, Bootstrap**:
    * Includes: json2, EventEmitter, easyXDM, and F2
    * Development: [f2.no-jquery-or-bootstrap.js](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/blob/master/sdk/packages/f2.no-jquery-or-bootstrap.js) 
    * Production: [f2.no-jquery-or-bootstrap.min.js](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/blob/master/sdk/packages/f2.no-jquery-or-bootstrap.min.js) (11.5kb)

## Versioning

The latest version of F2.js will always be in the root of the project, and the version number can be found embedded in the code. The version number is also available on the command line by using:

`$> grunt version`.

In accordance with industry standards, F2 is currently maintained, in as far as reasonably possible, under the Semantic Versioning guidelines.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

For more information on SemVer, please visit [SemVer.org](http://semver.org/).

## Upgrading

It is our goal to make upgrading to the latest version of F2 a minor effort for development teams. The details from each release of F2, minor and major, are tracked in the [changelog](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/wiki/Changelog). As of version 1.2, no breaking changes have been introduced and therefore upgrading should be as simple as [downloading the latest copy of F2.js](https://raw.github.com/OpenF2/F2/master/sdk/f2.min.js) and updating your website.

Developers can quick-link to the latest copy of F2.js:

`https://raw.github.com/OpenF2/F2/master/F2.latest.js`

<span class="label label-info">Note</span> GitHub is [not a CDN](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5502540/should-github-be-used-as-a-cdn-for-javascript-libraries).

A download ([zip](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/zipball/master)) of the current version ({{version}}) of F2 is always available along with [tags of previous releases](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/releases).

### Deprecated Features

There is a page on the wiki [tracking deprecated features in F2](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/wiki/F2.js-Deprecated). Starting with version 1.2, three `ContainerConfig` properties have been retired. As F2 features and/or F2.js APIs are deprecated, we will attempt to give reasonable advance notice via any or all of the F2 [communication channels](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#keep-in-touch). In addition, we will strive to ensure that backward compatibility will be maintained for at least one major version of F2. For example, if `Feature X` is deprecated in version `1.3`, we will attempt to maintain backward compatibility until the next major release (version `2.0`). F2 documentation will be updated accordingly to reflect any changes, and the conversation behind deprecated features will be publicly [available on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/issues).


### Third Party Libraries

F2 uses third party libraries inside F2.js (see [Framework: Choices](http://docs.openf2.org/#choices)). These open-source libraries are all on their own release schedules. We cannot guarantee that we will always stay abreast and in tune with such latest releases, but in an effort to improve the F2 framework, we will attempt to update F2.js so that it uses the latest, most stable and most secure version of the third party software. These updates to F2 will be made through the normal release process on GitHub and comments will be open.
