### Build F2 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OpenF2/F2.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OpenF2/F2)

For those wishing to [contribute back to F2](../CONTRIBUTING.md), we've included a `build` file in the project which contains the logic for compiling F2.js and the specification docs. The build script runs [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and has a few dependencies. To configure your environment, be sure you have Node installed and run the following command from the project root directory:

`$> npm install`

Depending on your configuration, you may need to be an admin to install some of these Node packages. Additionally, some packages may need to be [installed globally](http://blog.nodejs.org/2011/03/23/npm-1-0-global-vs-local-installation/) using the `-g` switch. If the installation fails due to directory permissions, use:

`$> sudo npm install`

Additionally, some packages may need to be [installed globally](http://blog.nodejs.org/2011/03/23/npm-1-0-global-vs-local-installation/) using the `-g` switch.

To **build F2**, `cd` to the `build` directory and run:

For help, run:

`$> node build -h`

We are using [markitdown](https://github.com/markitondemand/markitdown), a lightweight pandoc wrapper, for converting markdown files to HTML for the [docs](http://docs.openf2.org). [pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) is required for markitdown.

#### NuGet Package

Good news if you're using C#! We have an [F2 NuGet package available](https://nuget.org/packages/F2/). In the Package Manager Console run:

`PM> Install-Package F2`

## Versioning

To adhere to industry standards, F2 will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

You can run this command to check the version of your local copy of F2:
