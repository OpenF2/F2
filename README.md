# An open web framework for the financial services industry.

<img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4a9321787652abeea63089c8fdf0face?s=125" align="right">

F2 is an open and free web integration framework designed to help the financial services community develop custom web and mobile applications. These solutions can combine the best tools and content from multiple parties into one, privately-labeled, seamlessly integrated front-end.

F2 is currently maintained by [Markit On Demand](http://www.markitondemand.com). Visit [OpenF2.org](http://www.openf2.org) for more information, follow [@OpenF2](http://twitter.com/OpenF2) on Twitter and subscribe to the [F2 blog](http://blog.openf2.org).

## Get Started

Two core components of F2 are **containers** and **apps** which are stitched together by **F2.js**. Get started by browsing to the framework documentation at [**docs.openf2.org**](http://docs.openf2.org).

#### Setup

Be sure you have cloned this repository and have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed, then run the following command from the project root directory:

`$> npm install`

This command will install the [Grunt CLI](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#installing-the-cli) in addition to all dependencies needed to build F2. Depending on your configuration, you may need to be an admin to install some of these Node packages. Additionally, some packages may need to be [installed globally](http://blog.nodejs.org/2011/03/23/npm-1-0-global-vs-local-installation/) using the `-g` switch. If the installation fails due to directory permissions, use:

`$> sudo npm install`

We are using [markitdown](https://github.com/markitondemand/markitdown), a lightweight pandoc wrapper, for converting markdown files to HTML for the [F2 docs](http://docs.openf2.org). **[Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/index.html) is required** for markitdown and there are [installation packages available](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html) for Windows and Mac OS.

#### Build F2

To compile F2.js and the accompanying docs, run:

`$> grunt`

For help and a list of available grunt tasks, run:

`$> grunt --help`

### Versioning

The latest version of F2.js will always be in `master` and the version number/release date is available on the command line by using:

`$> grunt version`.

In accordance with industry standards, F2 is currently maintained, in as far as reasonably possible, under the Semantic Versioning guidelines. Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

For more information on SemVer, please visit [SemVer.org](http://semver.org/).

#### Upgrading

It is our goal to make upgrading to the latest version of F2 a minor effort for development teams. [Read more in the Docs](http://docs.openf2.org/f2js-sdk.html#upgrading).
